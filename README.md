This app allows users to query the New York Times article database and save the articles they find interesting for later viewing.

Project built using React, Express, Node, MongoDB, Axios, and New York Times article API.

Uses Express and Node to establish backend server to display front end views through React and establish api/database interaction. React components use axios request information from NYT API while also making GET and POST requests to backend API to request and send data to database/front end components. Mongoose.JS was the ORM used to handle information when a route was successfully called.
